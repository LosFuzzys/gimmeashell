# gimmeashell

So you somehow got command execution, but not yet a nice interactive shell.
This will try to give you one or simulate one for you.

## Installation



## TODO

- do something like (https://github.com/praetorian-inc/pyshell)[pyshell] but
  more flexible and also support pwntools tubes.
- add reverse shell helper scripts
  - start reverse shell listener (maybe on remote host?)
  - try some tricks to get a reverse shell (nc, bash)
- something like a minimal protocol for sending/receiving commands
